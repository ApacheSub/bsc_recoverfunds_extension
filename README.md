# bsc_recoverfunds_extension
A repository for tool(s) to recover access to funds lost due to Binance Chain Wallet extension

This tool will help users who have lost funds due to the Binance Chain Wallet extension where
it generated addresses from Ledger that users could not spend from.

The tool is simple but requires the Ledger Recovery Phrase. It's recommended to do it on an offline device. It's preferred to use
a live OS such as Tails OS to do this with networking disabled.

Donations are always welcomed as I do not ask any payment to release this.

There is users on Reddit who charge money AND ask your ledger seed to recover their funds. This is what motivated
me to release it for everyone.
